<h4 id="forth">An important tradition of celebrating Halloween is the organization of the so-called Haunted attractions (from the English. - "Attractions inhabited by ghosts"), the main purpose of which is to pleasantly scare visitors. The oldest such attraction is the "Haunted House of Orton and Spooner", opened in 1915. In most cases, this business has a clear seasonal framework. From the usual "haunted houses" these attractions differ in the use of haystacks and corn mazes in symbolism.</h4>

<h5 id="five">Especially for the celebration prepare Apple caramel, apples in syrup (sometimes with the addition of nuts), Apple toffee. At first, there was a tradition of handing out candy apples to children, but it quickly came to naught because of the urban legend, which said that such candy evil people put pins and needles</h5>

<p>In turn, in North America, candy corn and candy pumpkins, candy in the form of corn and pumpkin, respectively, are popular. Candy corn is a candy made of sugar, corn syrup, artificial colors and binders.The main difference between "pumpkin" and "corn" is the use of honey, more abundant addition of marshmallows and, finally, often used special low-fat cream.</p>

<p>For Russia, Halloween is an exotic and ambiguous holiday. According to sociological surveys of the Levada Center, four out of five Russians surveyed know about the holiday, but only one in twenty respondents plans to celebrate it. The situation is gradually changing, there are shops selling costumes for Halloween, and its celebration is included in the schedule of shopping centers and Nightclubs. The Russian Orthodox Church has a negative attitude to the holiday. The head of communications of the Russian Orthodox Church Georgy Zavershinsky calls the celebration a "carnival of evil" and "religious festival, which is incompatible with the Russian culture".</p>
