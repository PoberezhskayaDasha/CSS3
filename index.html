<h4 id="forth">An important tradition of celebrating Halloween is the organization of the so-called Haunted attractions (from the English. - "Attractions inhabited by ghosts"), the main purpose of which is to pleasantly scare visitors. The oldest such attraction is the "Haunted House of Orton and Spooner", opened in 1915. In most cases, this business has a clear seasonal framework. From the usual "haunted houses" these attractions differ in the use of haystacks and corn mazes in symbolism.</h4>
